# SGCCA hyperparameters

The goal of SGCCA_hyperparameters is to evaluate the influence of the hyperparameters tau, and weight in the Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis


The 014850_D_GeneList20070207.txt file was downloaded from [Agilent](https://www.chem.agilent.com/cag/bsp/gene_lists.asp) on 2018/07/18 from [here](https://www.chem.agilent.com/cag/bsp/oligoGL/014850_D_GeneList_20070207.txt.zip), uncompressed and stored for mapping the ids of the genes with the names of the proteins.

The original data is stored [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-1107/) with the annotation for each microarray. 

(the downloaded file and the original in ebi seem to match after randomly checking some GE identifiers)
